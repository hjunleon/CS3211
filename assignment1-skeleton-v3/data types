An orderâ€™s EXECUTION ID is a number starting from 1, incrementing serially each time that resting order is matched. 
 - std::atomic<int> atomic_counter = 0;
 - fetch_add per match 
 - execution_id increases per match, resting_id stays the same

resting_order_id and order_id/new_order_id can be global std::atomic<int>
